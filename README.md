# FlameTutorial

# Overview
This is a simple 2D game made in the Dart language and the Flutter framework using the Flame engine that is built on top of the Flutter framework.

This game is a small sprite that is controlled by the player and then avoids the Water Enemy to get the Star.

This is to demonstrate how to use the Flame engine in a simple 2D game.
{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a one minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code.}

For this project it was developed in Android Studio Dolphin v0.0.0 on an M1 Pro 14 inch MacBook Pro.

This program is written in Dart. Dart is a multi-purpose, object-oriented programming language that is typically used with Flutter to develop mobile apps. Flame is a game engine built on top of Flutter for the same reason.
